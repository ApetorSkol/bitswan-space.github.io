This post introduces how to use **BitSwan Jupyter Automations** to create your first automation using a **WebForm source**. Youâ€™ll learn how to set up a simple automation pipeline, define a web form, and handle the data submitted through it.


## Jupyter Automation

If you have a BitSwan workspace with the **VS Code editor** and the **BitSwan extension** installed, youâ€™re ready to get started. Below is an example automation script. Weâ€™ll go through it cell by cell and explain each part of the pipeline.

### 1. Import Required Modules
```python
from bspump.jupyter import *
from bspump.http.web.server import *
```

The first cell as usual imports the necessary modules.
- `bspump.jupyter` module is used to run and handle the automation in the jupyter notebook.
- The `bspump.http.web.server` module is used to create a web server that will serve the web form.

### 2. Define an Initial Event (Optional)
```python
event = {
    "form" : {"textfile": "text"}
}
```
This optional cell defines an `event` dictionary that will be used throughout the automation to store and access data. It can help structure how data flows through the pipeline.

### 3. Define the Automation Pipeline
```python
auto_pipeline(
    source=lambda app, pipeline: WebFormSource(app, pipeline, route="/", fields=[
        TextField("foo", display="Foo"),
        TextField("la", readonly=True, default="laa"),
        IntField("n"),
        TextField("le", hidden=True),
        ChoiceField("lol", choices=["a","b","c"]),
        CheckboxField("checkbox"),
    ]),
    sink=lambda app, pipeline: WebSink(app,pipeline)
)
```
This is the **core of the automation**. We use `auto_pipeline` to define our pipeline with minimal boilerplate:

- Source: `WebFormSource` renders a form at the root path (`/`) with a set of fields.
- Sink: `WebSink` handles the final processed output of the automation. and displays it on the web page.

The form includes:
- Text fields (some with defaults or hidden)
- An integer input
- A dropdown (choice field)
- A checkbox

ðŸ‘‰ You can mix and match different sources and sinks to create your desired automation.

### 4. Handle Form Submission

```python
event["response"] = {
            "msg": event["form"]["foo"],
            "checkbox": event["form"]["checkbox"],
            "n": event["form"]["n"],
            "lol": event["form"]["lol"]
        }
```
Cell below the `automation_pipeline` definition are executed when the pipeline is triggered.

In this case:
- Once the form is sumitted, `WebFormSource` creates an event.
- The `event` object includec the submitted `form` data.
- We consturct a new `response` field in the event using the selected form input values.

If the evnt is defined in the last cell of the notebook, it will be **automatically sent to the `WebSink`**.

It is important to mention that your automation can have any functionality you desire. The `WebFormSource` can only be used just as a trigger for your automation, what you do with jupyter cells and the event data is up to you.


Wow! You've just created your first automation using a WebForm source. ðŸŽ‰

### Conclusion

In this guide, we walked through the process of creating a **WebForm-based automation** using BitSwan Jupyter Automations. You learned how to:

- Import and set up required modules

- Define a form-based source

- Process and structure incoming form data

- Output the final result via a sink

This example is a great starting point. From here, you can expand your automations with custom logic, additional sources and sinks, and other powerful BitSwan capabilities.
